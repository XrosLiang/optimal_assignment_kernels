# Optimal Assignment Kernels
Source code for the paper [On Valid Optimal Assignment Kernels and Applications to Graph Classification](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6166-on-valid-optimal-assignment-kernels-and-applications-to-graph-classification.pdf), Nils M. Kriege, Pierre-Louis Giscard, Richard C. Wilson, NIPS 2016.

## Usage
The graph kernels contained in this package can be computed via a command line interface. Run the shell script `kkernel` to see a list of all available kernels and parameters.

### Example
The following command computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel with 0 to 4 refinement steps for the data set ENZYMES:
```
./kkernel -d ENZYMES wloa -h 0,1,2,3,4
```
For each value of `h` the kernel matrix is computed and stored in the directory `gram` using the [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) file format.

## Building from source
Run `ant` to build `kgraph.jar` from source. 

## Data sets
The repository contains the data set ENZYMES only. Further data sets are available from the website [Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels](http://graphkernels.cs.tu-dortmund.de).
